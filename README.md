# Bubble Sort: 
## When sorting from least to greatest:

    The bubble sort algorithm repeatedly passes over a list, swapping adjacent out-of-order elements.
    After each pass, the largest element settles at the end; it stops when a pass makes no swaps.
##### Good for almost-sorted lists—it only swaps neighbors and can stop early. Also keeps equal items in their original order.

# Selection Sort: 
When sorting from least to greatest:

    For each index, the algorithm finds the smallest element in the remaining unsorted portion and swaps it into that position. 
    The sorted region grows from the front by one each pass.
##### Good when you want very few swaps/writes—it finds the smallest and moves it to the front each round. Simple and uses little memory.
